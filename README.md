# courses-golang
I'm starting to master the golang and github language. The repository does not claim to be "best practice", and the quality of the code may be poor. The repository was created only for the purpose of comparing its code quality at the beginning of the path and in the future. And maybe employers may also be interested in my potential before calling for an interview.
